## Docstrings

Python documentation string or commonly known as docstring, is a string literal, and it is used in the class, module, function, or method definition. Docstrings are accessible from the doc attribute (__doc__) for any of the Python objects and also with the built-in help() function. An object's docstring is defined by including a string constant as the first statement in the object's definition.

Docstrings are similar in spirit to commenting, but they are enhanced, more logical, and useful version of commenting. Docstrings act as documentation for the class, module, and packages.

Docstrings are represented with closing & opening quotes while comments start with a # at the beginning.

There are a couple of ways of writing or using a Docstring:
* The one-line Docstrings are the Docstrings, which fits all in one line. You can use one of the quotes, i.e., triple single or triple-double quotes, and opening quotes and closing quotes need to be the same. 

* Multi-line Docstrings also contains the same string literals line as in One-line Docstrings, but it is followed by a single blank along with the descriptive text.
