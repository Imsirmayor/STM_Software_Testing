# Selenium 

Selenium Python bindings provides a simple API to write functional/acceptance tests using **Selenium WebDriver**.

Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers.

* **WebDriver**\
  WebDriver uses **browser automation APIs** provided by browser vendors to **control browser** and run tests. 
  This is as if a real user is operating the browser. 
  
* **IDE**\
  IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the tool you use to develop your Selenium test cases. 
  It’s an easy-to-use **Chrome and Firefox extension** and is generally the most efficient way to develop test cases. 
  It **records the users’ actions** in the browser for you, using existing Selenium commands, with parameters defined 
  by the context of that element. 
  This is not only a time-saver but also an **excellent way of learning Selenium** script syntax.

* **Grid**\
  Selenium Grid allows you to **run test cases in different machines** across different platforms. 
  The control of triggering the test cases is on the local end, and when the test cases are triggered, 
  they are automatically executed by the remote end.
  After the development of the WebDriver tests, you may face the need of running your tests on multiple 
  browser and operating system combinations. This is where Grid comes into the picture.
