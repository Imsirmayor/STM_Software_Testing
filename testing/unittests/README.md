# Unit Tests

Rather than initially testing the program as a whole, testing is first focused on the smaller building blocks of 
the program. 

The most important properties of unit and component tests are:
* Unit tests **verify functionality** of a small subset of the system (**functions and objects**).
* Component tests verify the behaviour of a larger part of the system (**group of objects**).
* Unit and component tests are **automated and written in the same programming language as the application**.
* Unit and component tests are **implemented by the developer team** (the tester supports the team by defining test cases).  

The following topics are important for implementing good unit tests:
* [Unit Testing Basics](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwaretesting/tree/master/testing/unittests/basics)
* [Fixture Setup](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwaretesting/tree/master/testing/unittests/fixture)
* [Result Verification](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwaretesting/tree/master/testing/unittests/verification)
