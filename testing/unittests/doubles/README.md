# Mock Framework

When you substitute an object in your code, the **Mock** must look like the real 
object it is replacing. Otherwise, your code will not be able to use the *Mock* 
in place of the original object.

Since Mock can create arbitrary attributes on the fly, it is suitable to replace any object.
