# Python Tutorial

In this repository, we use the Python programming language to learn about different testing techniques.
For this reason, it is important to understand the basics of the Python programming language.
Fortunately, Python is a very common language and there are numerous freely available resources on the Internet.

If you need help on individual topics related to Python programming, first check the official
