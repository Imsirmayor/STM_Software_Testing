# Visual Studio Code for Python

Visual Studio Code is a **source code editor** with support for development operations like debugging, 
task running, and version control. 
It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle.

## Python 

Make sure that you have installed Python on your machine. If you use the Virtual Lab,
the following commands should work out of the box:
```    
    $ python --version 
    Python 2.7.16

    $ python3 --version 
    Python 3.7.3

    $ pip3 --version	
    pip 18.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

Basically, we could work directly with the command line Python interpreter like:
```    
$ python3
Python 3.7.3 (default, Jul 25 2020, 13:03:44) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
```    
But for more sophisticated examples we use a more comfortable editor ...
